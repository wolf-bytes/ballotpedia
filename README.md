# Ballotpedia Data Analysis
An analysis of local, state, and federal political data from [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Main_Page) to inform Wolf-PAC decision making. 

## Project status: inactive due to cost
Apparently accessing the API key costs thousands of dollars per month and requires specific data requests. The lowest cost option is a one-time bulk csv dump (non-API) of a requested report for $600. **Based on that information, we are no longer pursuing the use of the Ballotpedia API at this time.** 

## Background information
Ballotpedia is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization which provides "accurate and objective infomration about politics at the local, state, and federal level." In particular, their data is an excellent resource for tracking the outcomes of political elections. 

## Ballotpedia API
The [Ballotpedia API](https://ballotpedia.org/API-documentation) provides users the means to retrieve this data in an efficient manner. This API provides information on candidates such as their names, party affiliation, incumbency status, biographical information, contact information, campaign websites, district boundary maps, and election dates. See [the API website](https://ballotpedia.org/API-documentation) for more information.
